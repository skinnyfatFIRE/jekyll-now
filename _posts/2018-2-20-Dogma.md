title: FIRE dogma
---

There is a lot of dogma in the world of Financial Independence / Early Retirement... save more, spend less (no daily coffee habit! move to a low cost-of-living area!), all debt besides a mortgage is bad, buy low-cost diversified index funds. All directionally good advice, but at some point groupthink kicks in and critical thinking suffers. I hope to explore all these areas and more, to see what the FIRE community gets right and where their conclusions miss the mark.
